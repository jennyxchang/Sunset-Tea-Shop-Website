                    <h2>Our story at Sunset Tea Shop...</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Sunset Tea Shop was established on May 31th, 2020, in Corvallis, Oregon. It was founded by three
                        friends who love to drink tea together. The idea of a tea shop sprouted during one of their tea
                        sessions. They have always wanted to share their love for tea with their community. They also
                        wanted to provide their community with a place to relax and socialize with friends and family.
                    </p>
                    <p>Voila! Sunset Tea Shop was born!</p>
                    <p>The name Sunset came from the founders always having tea while looking at sunset.</p>

                    <h2>The history and benefits of tea...</h2>
                    <p>For thousands of years, people from different cultures have consumed tea. There are many
                        varieties of tea, such as black tea, green tea, white tea, herbal tea, and many more.</p>
                    <p> There are numerous benifits from drinking tea. Studies have shown that tea contains antioxidants
                        that may help with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, weight loss, cholesterol, and mental
                        alertness. Studies also found tea to have some antimicrobial effects.</p>
